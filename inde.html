    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><del>CSS is not necessary</del> <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can contol the layout of multiple
            web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li><u>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</u></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="color: red;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however, <mark>in this
                tutitorial we
                will use inline and internal styles,</mark> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to
            try it
            yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 >When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the
        other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</h3>

    <p class="small">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

    <p class="pra">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
